   - Added cleanup of existing editor elements before creating new ones
   - Enhanced the cleanup function with better logging

2. **Updated Placeholder Text**:
   - Changed from "Let's write an awesome story" to "Start writing your story here..."
   - More professional and clear instruction

3. **Fixed Tools Component Placeholder**:
   - Changed "Type Heading...." to "Enter heading..." for consistency
   - Removed extra dots and made it more professional

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Before
placeholder: "Let's write an awesome story",

// After  
placeholder: "Start writing your story here...",

// Added DOM cleanup
const existingEditor = textEditorRef.current.querySelector('.codex-editor');
if (existingEditor) {
  console.log("Editor instance already exists in DOM, cleaning up...");
  existingEditor.remove();
}
```

### 2. **Missing Publish Button in Review Section** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: User reported that there should be a publish button in the review section.

   - Added a prominent publish button in the preview section

   - Added rocket emoji (üöÄ) for better visual appeal
   - Added helpful text below the button

2. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - Button is clearly visible in the preview section
   - Added instructional text: "Review your blog details below before publishing"
   - Maintained the existing publish button in the form section for redundancy

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
{/* Publish Button in Preview Section */}
<div className="mt-6 pt-4 border-t border-gray-200">
  <button
    onClick={publishBlog}
    className={`w-full py-3 rounded-lg text-white font-semibold text-sm sm:text-base ${
      isLoading ? "bg-gray-400 cursor-not-allowed" : "bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700"
    } transition`}
    disabled={isLoading}
  >
    {isLoading ? "Publishing..." : "üöÄ Publish Blog"}
  </button>

    Review your blog details below before publishing
  </p>
</div>
```
